            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Noise-robust bandwidth expansion faces a persistent trade-off between spectral fidelity, measured by log-spectral distance (LSD), and perceptual quality, assessed by DNSMOS. To address this, we propose a novel framework designed to achieve balanced improvements on both fronts. Our approach leverages conditional flow matching for accurate high-frequency generation, conditioned on noise-robust self-supervised features (XEUS) that provide semantic guidance to distinguish speech from noise. In addition, we introduce PatchReplace, a simple yet effective augmentation strategy that substitutes corrupted spectrogram regions with clean counterparts, mitigating the information loss of masking and the temporal inconsistency of mixing while encouraging the model to learn robust speech patterns. Evaluations on the Valentini-Botinhao noisy test set demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both LSD and overall DNSMOS. Audio samples are available.</a></p>
